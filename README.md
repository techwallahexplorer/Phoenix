## 🌟 Overview

LLM Flashcard Generator is a modern Streamlit web app that transforms any educational content—be it textbook excerpts, lecture notes, or even a single word—into effective, editable flashcards. Powered by Google Gemini, it is designed for students, educators, and lifelong learners who want to supercharge their revision and teaching.
